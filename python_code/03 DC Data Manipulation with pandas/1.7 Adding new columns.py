# Exercise
# Adding new columns
# You aren't stuck with just the data you are given. Instead, you can add new columns to a DataFrame. This has many names, such as transforming, mutating, and feature engineering.

# You can create new columns from scratch, but it is also common to derive them from other columns, for example, by adding columns together or by changing their units.

# homelessness is a DataFrame containing estimates of homelessness in each U.S. state in 2018. The individual column is the number of homeless individuals not part of a family with children. The family_members column is the number of homeless individuals part of a family with children. The state_pop column is the state's total population.

# homelessness is available and pandas is loaded as pd.

# Instructions
# 100 XP
# Add a new column to homelessness, named total, containing the sum of the individuals and family_members columns.
# Add another column to homelessness, named p_homeless, containing the proportion of the total homeless population to the total population in each state state_pop.

# Add total col as sum of individuals and family_members
homelessness['total'] = homelessness['individuals'] + homelessness['family_members']

# Add p_homeless col as proportion of total homeless population to the state population
homelessness['p_homeless'] = homelessness['total'] / homelessness['state_pop']

# See the result
print(homelessness)
