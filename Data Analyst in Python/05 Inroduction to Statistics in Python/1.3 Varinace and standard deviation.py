# Variance and standard deviation
# Variance and standard deviation are two of the most common ways to measure the spread of a variable, and you'll practice calculating these in this exercise. Spread is important since it can help inform expectations. For example, if a salesperson sells a mean of 20 products a day, but has a standard deviation of 10 products, there will probably be days where they sell 40 products, but also days where they only sell one or two. Information like this is important, especially when making predictions.

# pandas has been imported as pd, numpy as np, and matplotlib.pyplot as plt; the food_consumption DataFrame is also available.

# Instructions

# Calculate the variance and standard deviation of co2_emission for each food_category with the .groupby() and .agg() methods; compare the values of variance and standard deviation.
# Create a histogram of co2_emission for the beef in food_category and show the plot.
# Create a histogram of co2_emission for the eggs in food_category and show the plot.
