# The CLT in action
# The central limit theorem states that a sampling distribution of a sample statistic approaches the normal distribution as you take more samples, no matter the original distribution being sampled from.

# In this exercise, you'll focus on the sample mean and see the central limit theorem in action while examining the num_users column of amir_deals more closely, which contains the number of people who intend to use the product Amir is selling.

# pandas as pd, numpy as np, and matplotlib.pyplot as plt are loaded and amir_deals is available.
